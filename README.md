#### Part 4: Conclusions
* Considering the total conversion rates, there is a significant drop from 100% of users viewing items, to 29% of users who added items to their shopping cart, and only 10% of those 
  who added items to their carts actually purchased the items. Considering the conversion rates to the next step, the same drop occurs of 100% of users viewing items, to 29% of users 
  who added items to their shopping carts. Interestingly, 36% of the users who added items to their cart actually purchased those items.
* When considering the results of the retention rates, there are 5 individual cohorts separated by month, starting from 2020-09 to 2021-01. There are a total of 5 cohort ages, however 
  cohort age 0 is not included since you cannot calcuate the retention rate of the 0th cohort. For cohort 2020-09 the individual retention rates are 13%, 6%, 0%, 3% for cohort ages 1-4 
  respectively. For cohort 2020-10 the retention rates are 7%, 4%, 1% and 1% for cohort ages 1-4 respectively. For cohort 2020-11, the individual retention rates are 5%, 3%, 0% and 0% 
  for cohort ages 1-4 respectively. For cohort 2020-12, the individual retention rates are 4%, 3%, 0% and 0% for cohort ages 1-4 respectively. And lastly, for cohort 2021-01, the 
  individual retention rates are 7%, 0%, 0%, and 0% for cohort ages 1-4 respectively.
